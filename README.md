# Flow for the Arduino
Flow is a drag-and-drop (prototype) dataflow programming environment for the Arduino. It is built on the <a href="http://concurrency.cc/">Plumbing libraries</a> for <a href="http://occam-pi.org/">occam-pi</a>, and executes on the <a href="http://transterpreter.org/">Transterpreter virtual machine</a>.

## Download
You can download Flow for [Mac](http://goo.gl/HNalJ), [Linux](), and [Windows](). If you have problems, please join the [users mailing list](http://concurrency.cc/docs/mailinglists.html) at concurrency.cc. (This is a very,very early-stage prototype---you have been warned.)

## The Nitty Gritty
You can find out more about the underlying tools and technologies at <a href="http://concurrency.cc/">concurrency.cc</a>.
